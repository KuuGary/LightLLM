The Localization dataset combines intensity readings from 27 different light sensors to model the influence of light intensity on determining a person's location within a room. The dataset captures observations in repeated cycles of 28 readings each. Each cycle consists of 27 sensor readings followed by 1 location label, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the environmental light conditions and their impact on determining the person's position.

This setup is tailored to enhance models that infer a person's position based on light sensor data, leveraging intricate relationships between varied light intensities and location. The primary objective is to utilize sequences of light intensity data from the 27 sensors to accurately predict the corresponding location within the room. There are 51 predefined positions, numbered from 0 to 50, representing possible locations where the person can be found.
